# My Personal Project

## Game stats tracker

A *tracking application* that records all your game statistics
Players will enter the statistic of games and this app will 
**compute data and generate graphs** for helping players to
analyze and improve their performance.
I realized the stats analyzation is very important for improving players performance 
as I am a former-professional fps video game player, which makes this project is useful.

**tool list**:
- compute average damage
- compute win rate
- generate stats graphs
- generate play against stats

As user:
- I want to be able to create a team and add new player.
- I want to be able to select an individual player and check stats of the player.
- I want to be able to select a team and check the team stats.
- I want to be able to add a game and update the stats.
