# My Personal Project

## Game stats tracker

A *tracking application* that records all your game statistics
Players will enter the statistic of games and this app will 
**compute data and generate graphs** for helping players to
analyze and improve their performance.
I realized the stats analyzation is very important for improving players performance 
as I am a former-professional fps video game player, which makes this project is useful.
